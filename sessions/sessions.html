                                        <li>A manager’s office in a polychronic culture typically has an open door, a ringing phone and a meeting all going on at the same time.</li>
                                        <li>Though they can be easily distracted they also tend to manage interruptions well.</li>
                                        <li>Willingness to change plans often and easily.</li>
                                        <li>People are their primary concern (particularly those closely related to them or their function).</li>

                                <li>How hard was it to tell the other group no without saying no?</li>
                                <li>Was it hard for you to understand what the other group was trying to say or did you understand they were trying to say no?</li>
                                <li>High Context Cultures
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Relationships build slowly and depend on trust. Productivity depends on relationships and the group process. An individual’s identity is rooted in groups (family, culture, work). Social structure and authority are centralized.</li>
                                        <li>Nonverbal elements such as voice tone, gestures, facial expression and eye movement are significant. Verbal messages are indirect, and communication is seen as an art form or way of engaging someone. Disagreement is personalized, and a person is sensitive to conflict expressed in someone else’s nonverbal communication.</li>
                                        <li>Space is communal. People stand close to each other and share the same space.</li>
                                        <li>Everything has its own time, and time is not easily scheduled. Change is slow, and time is a process that belongs to others and nature.</li>
                                        <li>Multiple sources of information are used. Thinking proceeds from general to specific. Learning occurs by observing others as they model or demonstrate and then practicing. Groups are preferred, and accuracy is valued.</li>
                                        <li>Latin America, Africa, Southern Europe</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Low Context Cultures
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Relationships begin and end quickly. Productivity depends on procedures and paying attention to the goal. The identity of individuals is rooted in themselves and their accomplishments. Social structure is decentralized.</li>
                                        <li>Nonverbal elements are not significant. Verbal messages are explicit, and communication is seen as a way of exchanging information, ideas and opinions. Disagreement is depersonalized; the focus is on rational (not personal) solutions. An individual can be explicit about another person’s bothersome behavior.</li>
                                        <li>Space is compartmentalized. Privacy is important, so people stand farther apart.</li>
                                        <li>Events and tasks are scheduled and to be done at particular times. Change is fast, and time is a commodity to be spent or saved. One’s time is one’s own.</li>
                                        <li>One source of information is used. Thinking proceeds from specific to general. Learning occurs by following the explicit directions and explanations of others. Individual orientation is preferred, and speed is valued.</li>

                                        <li>Countries that have high power distance include many Latin American, African and Asian countries.</li>
                                        <li>Hierarchy is an essential part of the society, and unequal distribution of power is seen as beneficial.</li>
                                        <li>Those higher on the hierarchy are expected to take care of those lower on the hierarchy, and it is often appropriate for those in power to make decisions without consulting their subordinates.</li>
                                        <li>Those lower on the hierarchy generally are expected to obey their superiors. For instance, students may not be allowed to argue with their professors, and it may not be acceptable for employers to disagree with their boss.</li>

                                        <li>More acceptable for those who are junior in age or rank to question authority. For instance, students in schools and universities are encouraged to express opinions freely and disagree with their professors, while decisions in organizations are often reached by taking into account opinions of all employers.</li>
